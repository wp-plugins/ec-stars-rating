# EC Stars Rating #

A lightweigt, blazing fast star rating plugin for WordPress

## Description ##

A **super fast** **WordPress star rating plugin**, optimized for SEO, and with a really low impact on page load (just CSS + a bit of HTML, plus the strictly required JS for working).

## Installation ##

1. Upload the content of the zip package to `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure the plugin according to your needs. If you need help you can visit [the plugin page](http://emiliocobos.net/ec-stars-rating-wordpress-plugin/)
4. Place the following snippet where you want the stars to appear (normally `single.php`, `content-single.php` or `index.php`):

```php
<?php if(function_exists('ec_stars_rating')) {
	ec_stars_rating();
} ?>
```

5. Additionally, if you just want the rating to appear in a single post, you can use the next shortcode:
`[ec_stars_rating]`


## Frequently asked questions ##

### What rich snippets format should I use, microdata or microformats? ###

Actually, microdata is recommended by Google, but with microformats google detects the stars and uses them in your searches ([example](https://www.google.com/search?q=site:emiliocobos.net+ec+stars+rating)).

## How it works ##

Basically we create a new table called `(prefix)ec_stars_votes`, where we store the votes of the people (to prevent duplicate votes).

The number of votes and the sum of the total votes are stored in the `(prefix)options` table in form of custom meta fields, one for the count, and another for the sum. Both fields get updated when someone votes.
